Privacy Policy

The American Printing House for the Blind promotes independence of people who 
are blind and visually impaired by providing specialized materials, products, 
and services needed for education and life. 
We are committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of our customers and 
users. This Privacy Policy explains what information about you that we collect 
from our services and how we may maintain or share the information. 

Personal Information

We collect personal information from visitors to our website when you 
voluntarily provide it. We maintain the information to perform the internal 
operations of our website or services such as e-commerce, online product 
support programs, and communication transactions. 

Occasionally we share personal information with our vendors or third parties 
when needed to carry out your requests. We do not use or disclose the 
information for purposes other than the intended purpose. 

As part of research projects, we conduct various online surveys, often using 
third-party forms. Providing information by participating in our surveys is 
voluntary.

APH website uses a web traffic analytics service offered by Google. When you 
visit our website, the software automatically collects information such as the 
IP address of the websites from which you visited our website, the browser name 
and language you are using, and the URL of the webpages accessed by you. We use 
these automatically collected data for analytics to improve our services and 
systems only.

Our GPS mobile apps come equipped with onboard maps and do not require a Wi-Fi 
or cellular data connection. If you choose to use those apps on a network or use 
the online version of the apps, however, they are supported by third-party 
services. By using our GPS apps, you are bound by the terms of service and 
privacy policies of Google, Apple, and Foursquare. APH does not access or track 
your information stored on your mobile devices. Nor does APH collect your 
private data transmitted when you use the apps on a network connected to the 
Internet.

Some of our online apps have a user feedback feature. If you click a 
“Report Error” button, for example, we will collect and store on our server 
the error stack trace, the version number of the app, a generated unique ID 
that is saved to your user setting, and your IP address. We use the data to 
process your report and provide technical support only.

We take reasonable measures to protect our website and to safeguard the 
security of your information that we process and maintain.

Cookies Used by APH Website

Cookies are small files that a website sends to visitors’ computers that 
remember information such as a signed-in state and items added to a shopping 
cart. We use cookies for users who have created an APH shopping account.

To operate online shopping activities effectively, APH’s shopping sites use 
session cookies. If you have signed in to your shopping account, these session 
cookies are cleared when you sign out. Our shopping sites use persistent cookies 
to support your shopping activities across different user sessions. If you have 
created your shopping account, then your name, contact information, and purchase 
activities can be tracked. We use credit card information provided by you only 
for your purchasing transactions. We utilize appropriate technical and 
organizational security measures to protect your credit card information.

APH does not use cookies on other sites. However, some of our online apps 
use cookies to keep your place in the lesson sequence so you can resume 
from the last lesson you took. 

Disclaimer for External Links

APH is not responsible for the content of non-APH websites linked from our 
website or from our social media.

Children’s Privacy Policy

Our online and mobile applications are developed to provide educational aids for 
general audiences who have visual impairments, including children. We understand 
the importance of protecting children’s privacy in an online environment, and we 
comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

Some of our training apps have a login. The apps do not ask for personal 
information other than the student’s username and password. Whether stored 
locally on a device or remotely on our online servers, any personally 
identifiable data associated with the login is used only to support the internal 
operations of the lesson activities such as monitoring students’ progress. APH 
does not use or share any information stored on users’ devices or our online 
servers.

Our apps are often used by students on school mobile devices. It is the school 
or the teacher who is responsible for ensuring children’s privacy, 
confidentiality and security of personal information in regard to COPPA. If our 
software installed on a PC is used in a classroom or training environment, 
please make sure to remove the student(s) information at semester’s end.

We offer various online assessment and instructional support programs to 
teachers for students with visual impairments and school-centered vision care 
practitioners. Often these services are password protected to keep the 
confidentiality and security of student information recorded by the teachers. 
When applicable, schools should oversee any student education records subject to 
the privacy protections of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).  

APH does not knowingly collect information from children through our online 
services. However, if we are aware that a child under the age of 13 has emailed 
us a specific request, we will delete the child’s online contact information 
after the request is responded. 

Email Subscription Lists

If you subscribe to the APH News newsletter email notification or to a 
product-support email list, we retain your email address. For some of our 
product-support email lists, we may use third-party services. APH will use your 
email address only for the intended purpose. At your request, we will remove 
your email address immediately. 

Mailing Lists for Magazines, Free Books, and Catalogs

APH offers accessible magazines and free children’s print/braille books to 
eligible readers who are visually impaired. If you subscribe to our magazine or 
book-distribution services or request that we mail you a catalog or other 
promotional materials, APH will store your mailing address for future mailings. 
In order to help defray annual cost for each magazine, APH may occasionally 
email eligible magazine subscribers to ask for donations. We do not lend or sell 
your subscription mailing address to other organizations. At your request, we 
will remove your contact information from our mailing lists immediately.

Donor Mailing List

APH maintains a donor mailing list that is separate from other mailing lists. In 
order to keep our costs of fundraising low, APH may occasionally share donor 
mailing lists with other nonprofit organizations for a one-time use by these 
nonprofits. If you are a donor to APH and wish that we withhold your mailing 
information from list exchanges, please call Bob Belknap toll-free at 
1-800-223-1839, ext. 362 or send an email to bbelknap@aph.org. In the email 
subject field, please type "Mailing List Opt Out" and provide your name, email 
address, and the postal address used in making your donation to APH. APH donor 
lists are never sold to other organizations.

Updates to this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy has been updated on June 28, 2017. We may update this 
Privacy Policy as needed to reflect our expanded products and services.
