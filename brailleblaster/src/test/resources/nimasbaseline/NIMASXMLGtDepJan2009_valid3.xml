          </h2>
					<p id="L001.002.P001">
            Cities were hard hit by the Great Depression. By March of 1930, more than 3.2 million people were unemployed. Since most people lost their homes, homelessness ran rampant. People were living literally "in the streets." Whole families were living in boxes, under bridges and overpasses, and in alleys. The street corners of New York City were packed with people selling anything and everything to try and make money. <q>"Desperate times began to put into question the old American notion that if a man worked hard enough, he could always take care of himself and his family. The effect of the Depression on poor children was particularly severe.... Most elderly Americans did not have personal savings or retirement pensions to support them in normal times, let alone during a national economic crisis.... Even skilled workers, business owners, successful farmers, and professionals of all kinds found themselves in severe economic difficulty as one out of four in the labor force lost their jobs."

            People were living in the streets and they were starving. They were becoming angry and desperate. Food riots broke out across the nation. In Minneapolis, people smashed the windows of a store and stole fruit, canned goods, bacon, and ham. When one of the shop owners tried to stop them at gunpoint, one of the looters broke his arm. It took 100 police officers to bring the riot under control. Seven people were arrested.
          </p>
					<p id="L001.002.P003">
            Some cities tried to control the problem by distributing 
            food to people who waited in <strong>bread lines</strong> 
            to get a meal. In New York City, there were 82 different 
            bread lines located in different stations around the city. 
            In 1931, each of these lines averaged 85,000 meals a day. 
            A typical meal consisted of bread, soup, and stew. People 
            would stand in these lines for days waiting for one meal. 
            Many people fainted while standing in line from exhaustion, 
            fatigue, and hunger.
          </p>
					<p id="L001.002.P004">
            New York also tried to provide citywide relief to its homeless, 
            jobless masses. But by April of 1932, more than 750,000 New 
            Yorkers were dependent on city relief with a waiting list of 
            160,000 people. The people on relief began to outnumber the 
            people working. The city could not support this relief much longer.

					<p id="L001.002.P005">Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected in 1933 on his "new deal" platform of recovery and reform.  His inauguration speech contained the now-famous quote: "Let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself; needless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance."</p>
					<blockquote id="bq001">
						<p>
							<span class="inline">FDR's Inaugural Address, 1933:</span> President Hoover, Mr. Chief Justice, my friends: This is a day of national consecration, and I am certain that my fellow Americans expect that on my induction into the Presidency I will address them with a candor and a decision which the present situation of our nation impels. This is pre-eminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. This great nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So first of all let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days.</p>
						<p>In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties. They concern, thank God, only material things. Values have shrunken to fantastic levels: taxes have risen, our ability to pay has fallen, government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income, the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade, the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side, farmers find no markets for their produce, the savings of many years in thousands of families are gone.</p>
						<p>More important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return. Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment.</p>
						<p>Yet our distress comes from no failure of substance. We are stricken by no plague of locusts. Compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered because they believed and were not afraid, we have still much to be thankful for. Nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it. Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply. Primarily, this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failures and abdicated. Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men.</p>
						<p>True, they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit, they have proposed only the lending of more money. Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored conditions. They know only the rules of a generation of self-seekers. They have no vision, and when there is no vision the people perish.</p>
						<p>The money changers have fled their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit.</p>
						<p>Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money, it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort. The joy and moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits. These dark days will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves and to our fellow-men.</p>
						<p>Recognition of the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be values only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit, and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing. Small wonder that confidence languishes, for it thrives only on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection, on unselfish performance. Without them it cannot live.</p>
						<p>Restoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone. This nation asks for action, and action now.</p>
						<p>Our greatest primary task is to put people to work. This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously. It can be accompanied in part by direct recruiting by the government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our national resources.</p>
						<p>Hand in hand with this, we must frankly recognize the over-balance of population in our industrial centers and, by engaging on a national scale in a redistribution, endeavor to provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land. The task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the values of agricultural products and with this the power to purchase the output of our cities. It can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the growing loss, through foreclosure, of our small homes and our farms. It can be helped by insistence that the Federal, State, and local governments act forthwith on the demand that their cost be drastically reduced. It can be helped by the unifying of relief activities which today are often scattered, uneconomical, and unequal. It can be helped by national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and other utilities which have a definitely public character. There are many ways in which it can be helped, but it can never be helped merely by talking about it. We must act, and act quickly.</p>
						<p>Finally, in our progress toward a resumption of work we require two safeguards against a return of the evils of the old order: there must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments; there must be an end to speculation with other people's money, and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency.</p>
						<p>These are the lines of attack. I shall presently urge upon a new Congress in special session detailed measures for their fulfillment, and I shall seek the immediate assistance of the several States.</p>
						<p>Through this program of action we address ourselves to putting our own national house in order and making income balance outgo. Our international trade relations, though vastly important, are, to point in time and necessity, secondary to the establishment of a sound national economy. I favor as a practical policy the putting of first things first. I shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international economic readjustment, but the emergency at home cannot wait on that accomplishment.</p>
						<p>The basic thought that guides these specific means of national recovery is not narrowly nationalistic. It is the insistence, as a first consideration, upon the interdependence of the various elements in and parts of the United States ... a recognition of the old and permanently important manifestation of the American spirit of the pioneer. It is the way to recovery. It is the immediate way. It is the strongest assurance that the recovery will endure.</p>
						<p>In the field of world policy I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor; the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others; the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors.</p>
						<p>If I read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize, as we have never realized before, our interdependence on each other: that we cannot merely take, but we must give as well, that if we are to go forward we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline, because without such discipline, no progress is made, no leadership becomes effective. We are, I know, ready and willing to submit our lives and property to such discipline because it makes possible a leadership which aims at a larger good. This I propose to offer, pledging that the larger purposes will bind upon us all as a sacred obligation with a unity of duty hitherto evoked only in time of armed strife.</p>
						<p>With this pledge taken, I assume unhesitatingly the leadership of this great army of our people, dedicated to a disciplined attack upon our common problems.</p>
						<p>Action in this image and to this end is feasible under the form of government which we have inherited from our ancestors. Our Constitution is so simple and practical that it is possible always to meet extraordinary needs by changes in emphasis and arrangement without loss of essential form. That is why our constitutional system has proved itself the most superbly enduring political mechanism the modern world has produced. It has met every stress of vast expansion of territory, of foreign wars, of bitter internal strife, of world relations.</p>
						<p>It is to be hoped that the normal balance of executive and legislative authority may be wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before us. But it may be that an unprecedented demand and need for undelayed action may call for temporary departure from that normal balance of public procedure.</p>
						<p>I am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken nation in the midst of a stricken world may require. But in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of these courses, and in the event that the national emergency is still critical, I shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me. I shall ask the Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis—broad executive power to wage a war against the emergency as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.</p>
						<p>For the trust reposed in me I will return the courage and the devotion that befit the time. I can do no less.</p>
						<p>We face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage of national unity, with the clear consciousness of seeking old and precious moral values, with the clean satisfaction that comes from the stern performance of duty by old and young alike. We aim at the assurance of a rounded and permanent national life.</p>
						<p>We do not distrust the future of essential democracy. The people of the United States have not failed. In their need they have registered a mandate that they want direct, vigorous action. They have asked for discipline and direction under leadership. They have made me the present instrument of their wishes. In the spirit of the gift I take it.</p>
						<p>In this dedication of a nation we humbly ask the blessing of God. May He protect each and every one of us. May He guide me in the days to come.</p>

            Despite the election of FDR and all his New Deal programs, 
            unemployment in cities remained high and began to take its 
            toll on society. Unemployed men felt a loss of status because 
            they could not provide for their families. They became easily 
            agitated and irritable which resulted in many fights and 
            quarrels in public places. Women who had jobs suddenly 
            came under immense social pressure to give their jobs to 
            unemployed men. Women were told that men "deserved" the job 
            more than they did. Almost all married women lost their jobs, 
            even if they were the only person in the family working. 
            Women were relegated to servant positions that society saw 
            as more suited to women than men. These jobs usually paid 
            much less than the jobs they had to give up.
          </p>
					<p id="L001.002.P007">
            Children were also put to work. Boys and girls by the 
            hundreds dropped out of school and either began working 
            low-paying jobs or staying home to look after younger 
            siblings while both their parents worked. Teenagers 
            dropped out of school and frequently left their families. 
            Most could not find jobs and their families could not 
            support them. Many city youth ran away from the city and
            "rode the rails," or roamed the country by railroad. These 
            youth would sneak onto trains, beg for food, and live 
            in <strong>squatter</strong> camps along the railroad routes.</p>

              The Depression attacked farms as quickly and as 
              destructively as it did the cities. The problems 
              facing farmers were numerous and complex and could 
              not be fixed with a single solution.

                the dust bowl migration
              </h4>
							<p id="L001.002.001.001.P001">
                During the 1920s, farms were prospering and there was 
                such an abundance of rainfall that farmers all across 
                the western United States had become careless in their 
                farming techniques and soil preparation. Farmers 
                over-grazed livestock and over-plowed fields to make 
                more money. This damaged the land and destroyed the 
                regenerative properties of the soil. During the 1930s, 
                there was a large drought in the West, causing crops 
                to shrivel, cattle to die, and the topsoil to blow 
                away. This turned the West into one large 
                <strong>dust bowl</strong>.
              </p>
							<p id="L001.002.001.001.P002">
                The states in the dust bowl region were Kansas, Oklahoma, 
                Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico. This region was called 
                the dust bowl because of the large numbers of <strong>dust 
                storms</strong> that occurred there. However, other states 
                like Arkansas and the Dakotas were also plagued by dust 
                storms.
              </p>
							<p id="L001.002.001.001.P003">
                What is a dust storm? Dust storms are storms that last 
                for several days, driven by high winds. The winds blow 
                dust, creating huge dark, yellowish clouds that, at times, 
                can block out the light of the sun. Sometimes, these dust 
                clouds can get up to 8,000 feet high and be accompanied 
                by thunder and lightning. Two massive and highly 
                destructive dust storms occurred in the 1930s. The first 
                was in May of 1934.
              </p>

                A dust storm lasting three days blew across the West 
                and Southwest, pulling up over 350 million tons of soil 
                and dropping it as far east as New York City, New York 
                and Boston, Massachusetts. It was reported that these 
                cities had to turn on streetlamps in the daytime just 
                to be able to see through the blowing dust. The second 
                storm occurred in March of 1935 in the Dakotas and 
                Nebraska. It destroyed the entire wheat crop for both 
                states and swept away as much dirt as workers dug up 
                when they constructed the Panama Canal.

                Not only were these dust storms economically damaging, 
                they were a danger to the people living in these states. 
                People caught outside in dust storms could suffocate and 
                die from dust inhalation. Because of the havoc these 
                storms wreaked on the land and the people living on it, 
                people were forced to <strong>migrate</strong> to find 
                work or a new place to farm. Many packed up everything 
                they owned into trucks, cars, and wagons and began to 
                travel further west to California and other Pacific States. 
                Over 2.5 million people fled to California during the 
                Great Depression. The migrants began to gather nicknames 
                based on where they were migrating from such as "Oakies" 
                if they were from Oklahoma and "Arkies" if they were 
                from Arkansas. These people pushed west into Texas, Kansas, 
                Nebraska, and the Dakotas, and finding no relief in these 
                dust bowl-burdened states, pushed on to California.

                Unfortunately, California could not support the huge 
                influx of people that began to pour into the state. 
                California was not a huge farming state, and the small 
                farm towns it did have quickly became overcrowded and 
                overrun with migrants looking for work and land to farm. 
                By 1939, the problem had gotten so bad that the California 
                state government passed a law forbidding entry of any 
                new people into the state. The Supreme Court overturned 
                this law as unconstitutional, and people continued 
                to flood the state.
              </p>
							<p id="L001.002.001.001.P007">
                The federal government in the 1930s tried to alleviate 
                the crisis by taking measures to salvage the land that 
                had been destroyed by the dust storms and poor farming 
                techniques. In 1933, the government created the Soil 
                Erosion Service. This was a commission that taught 
                terracing and contour farming techniques to farmers to 
                help them preserve the soil. In 1936, the government 
                passed the Soil Conservation Act, which tried to reduce 
                farm surpluses and promote soil conservation. The 
                government also planted over 200 million trees in 
                the most ravaged parts of the dust bowl from the Dakotas 
                to Texas. These trees took to the soil and began to grow, 
                providing "shelter belts" along the West and conserving 
                water to help hold down the topsoil. The dust bowl was 
                slowly beginning to replenish itself.

                Aside from the growing dust storms and bad soil, there 
                was another class of farmers affected by the Great 
                Depression. These farmers were tenant farmers or 
                <strong>sharecroppers</strong>. After the Civil War, 
                sharecroppers replaced slaves on many farms. Some 
                sharecroppers were former slaves, while others were 
                poor white farmers. Sharecroppers, or tenant farmers, 
                did not own their land. They were not paid any wages. 
                Someone else owned the land they farmed and the 
                sharecroppers rented it. They paid these landowners 
                with a "share" of the crops and other goods produced 
                on that farm. Most of these farmers could only obtain 
                the seed, food, and clothes the needed each year by 
                pledging their harvest in advance.

                When the Great Depression hit these farms, not to mention 
                the dust storms, most sharecroppers had already pledged 
                their crops and other goods in advance. The dying crops 
                and bad soil could not produce enough for the farmers 
                to live off of, so they were unable to pay their share 
                to the landowners. As a result, they were forced to 
                leave the land, burdened with huge debts they had no 
                hope of paying.
              </p>
							<p id="L001.002.001.002.P003">
                The federal government, again, tried to help, by passing 
                the Federal Emergency Relief Act to help tenant farmers. 
                This act gave money, seeds, and equipment to these farmers 
                and tried to relocate them to better land. It helped 
                some, but not all sharecroppers, escape total poverty.

                Another major problem that farmers faced during the Great 
                Depression was lack of electricity. Before the depression hit, 
                only one in ten farms had electricity. After the depression 
                and the major dust storms, it became apparent that more 
                farms needed electricity and quickly! So the federal 
                government formed the Rural Electrification Administration 
                to bring electricity to farms in the West. The REA had 
                the power to loan money to farmers and small towns to help 
                them build generators and install power lines. This action 
                was one of the most revolutionary and successful actions 
                during the Great Depression. By 1941, four out of five 
                American farms now had electricity.

                  Powerful dust storms in the 1930s created a dust bowl

                  families were forced to migrate in droves to California

                Books, movies, and music were dedicated to bringing up 
                American morale. Most of the books were reality-based books 
                about the state of affairs such as <em>Let Us Now Praise 
                Famous Men</em> by James Agee and Walker Evans, that told 
                the story of tenant farmers, and <em>The Grapes of 
                Wrath</em> by John Steinbeck, that fictionalized the 
                story of a dust bowl family's migration west. Both of 
                these novels were extremely popular because they told 
                the truth and gave a voice to the people of the nation

                Movies took a different tack. Some studios projected the 
                image of the ideal life or a hopeful future, such as many 
                of the Shirley Temple movies of the 1930s. Others films 
                were pure escapism, like The Wizard of Oz. People flocked 
                to the movies either to be encouraged by the future or to 
                forget the present.

                Also during this time, comics were introduced with 
                superhero characters such as Superman. These comics

                The music industry also worked hard to raise people's 
                spirits. Many parlor songs of the time were uplifting, 
                with messages of hope for the future with titles such 
                as "When The Shepherd Leads the Sheep Back Home" (1931) 
                and "The Clouds Will Soon Roll By" (1932). Some songs

                Other types of entertainment slipped in to help society 
                refocus. In 1930, the first pinball machine hit the scene, 
                and in 1935, Parker Brothers distributed the first version 
                of the board game Monopoly. People took to these 
                distractions, and they helped to pass what was one of 
                the hardest times in American history.

                  The morale of the American people fell rapidly during 
                  the Great Depression. Books, movies, and music worked 
                  overtime to keep people hopeful and happy. These types 
                  of entertainment gave people hope and joy in a very 
                  tough time.
