					<em>A killer wave, known to mariners as a "rogue
						wave," was approaching a desolate area of Baja California
						below Ensenada. It had been born off the east coast of Australia
						during a violent storm; it had traveled almost 7,000 miles at a
						speed of 20.83 miles an hour. Driven by an unusual pattern of
						easterly winds, it was a little over 800 feet in length and
						measured about 48 feet from the bottom of its trough to its crest.
						On its passage across the Pacific, it had already killed thirteen
						people, mostly fishermen in small boats, but also an</em>

					Sullivan Atkins, Scoot&#x0027;s oldest brother, was steering the
					cutter-rigged boat on a northerly course about fifteen miles off
					desolate Cabo Colnett, south of Ensenada. Under a brilliant sun,
					the glittering blue Pacific rose and fell in long, slick
					<strong>swells</strong>
					, a cold light breeze holding steady.

					with them while slicing leftover steak from last night&#x0027;s

					the starboard side
					<noteref idref="#NIMAS9780544087507-note-002">2</noteref>
					at the stern, trailing sparks into the water. The

					Scoot was learning how to be a deep-water sailor. She was fourteen
					years old and pretty, with dark hair. Though small in size, not
					even five feet, she was strong. She&#x0027;d started off with
					eight-foot Sabots. On this trip, her first aboard the
					<em>Sea Dog</em>
					, she&#x0027;d manned the wheel for most of the three days
					they&#x0027;d been under way. She&#x0027;d stood four-hour watches
					at night. Sully was a
					<span class="linenum">50</span>
					good teacher.

					It was one of those perfect days to be out, Sully thought: the
					three Dacron sails belayed and whispering, white bow waves singing
					pleasant songs as the fiberglass hull, tilting to starboard, sliced
					through the ocean. It was a day filled with goodness, peace, and
					beauty. They&#x0027;d come south as far as Cabo Colnett, turning
					back north only an hour ago. They&#x0027;d sailed from Catalina
					Island&#x0027;s Avalon Harbor, the
					<em>Sea Dog&#x0027;s</em>
					home port, out in the channel off Los Angeles. Sully had borrowed
					the boat from a family friend, Beau Tucker,
					<span class="linenum">60</span>
					a stockbroker with enough money to outfit it and maintain it
					properly. Built by Ta-Shing, of Taiwan, she was heavy and sturdy,
					with a teakwood deck and handsome teakwood interior, and the latest
					in

					equipment. Sully had sailed her at least a dozen times. He&#x0027;d
					been around boats, motor and sail, for many of his nineteen years.
					He thought the
					<em>Old Sea Dog</em>
					was the best, in her category, that he&#x0027;d ever piloted.

					As he was about to complete a northeast tack, Sully&#x0027;s
					attention was drawn to a squadron of seagulls diving on
					<span class="linenum">70</span>
					small fish about a hundred yards off the port bow, and he did not
					see the giant wave that had crept up silently behind the
					<em>Sea Dog</em>
					. But a split second before it lifted the boat like a
					carpenter&#x0027;s chip, he sensed something behind him and glanced
					backward, toward the towering wall of shining water.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was already too late to shout a warning to Scoot so she could
					escape from the cabin; too late to do anything except hang on to
					the wheel with both hands; too late even to pray. He did manage a
					yell as the
					<em>Sea Dog</em>
					became vertical. She rose up the surface of the wall stern first
					and then pitch-poled
					<span class="linenum">80</span>
					violently, end over end, the bow
					<strong>submerging</strong>
					and the boat going upside down, taking Sully and Scoot with it, the
					forty-foot mast, sails intact, now pointing toward the bottom.

				<p>Scoot was hurled upward, legs and arms flying, her head striking
					the after galley bulkhead and then the companionway steps and the
					interior deck, which was now the ceiling. She instantly blacked
					out.</p>
				<p>
					Everything loose in the cabin was scattered around what had been
					the overhead. Water was pouring in and was soon lapping at
					Scoot&#x0027;s chin. It was coming from a four-inch
					<span class="linenum">90</span>

					Sully&#x0027;s feet were caught under forestay sailcloth, plastered
					around his face, but then he managed to shove clear and swim
					upward, breaking water. He looked at the mound of upside-down hull,
					bottom to the sky, unable to believe that the fine, sturdy
					<em>Sea Dog</em>
					had been flipped like a cork, perhaps trapping Scoot inside.
					Treading water, trying to collect his thoughts, he yelled,
					&#x201C;Scoot,&#x201D; but there was no answer. Heart pounding,
					unable to see over the mound of the hull, he circled
					<span class="linenum">100</span>
					it, thinking she might have been thrown clear. But there was no
					sign of her.
				</p>

						<em>&#x201C;Maneuvering his body, he pulled on the handles. The

					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					He swam back to the point of cabin entry, took several deep
					breaths, and dove. He felt along the hatch boards and then opened
					his eyes briefly to see that the doors were still closed. She
					<em>was</em>
					still inside. Maneuvering his body, he pulled on the handles. The
					doors were jammed, and he returned to the surface for air.
				</p>
				<p>
					He knew by the way the boat had already settled that there was
					water inside her. Under usual circumstances, the hull
					<span class="linenum">110</span>
					being upright, there would be four feet, nine inches of hull below
					the waterline. There would be about the same to the cabin overhead,
					enabling a six-foot-person to walk about down there.
				</p>
				<p>
					Panting, blowing, Sully figured there was at least a three-foot air
					pocket holding the
					<em>Sea Dog</em>
					on the surface, and if Scoot hadn&#x0027;t been knocked unconscious
					and drowned, she could live for quite a while in the dark chamber.
					How long, he didn&#x0027;t know.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the blackness, water continued to lap at Scoot&#x0027;s chin.
					She
					<span class="linenum">120</span>
					had settled against what had been the deck of the galley alcove,
					her body in an upright position on debris. Everything

					not tied down or in a locker was now between the overhead ribs.
					Wooden hatch covers
					<noteref idref="#NIMAS9780544087507-note-003">3</noteref>
					from the bilges were floating in the water and the naked bilges
					were exposed. Just aft of her body, and now above it, was the small
					diesel engine as well as the batteries. Under the water were cans
					of oil, one of them leaking. Battery acid might leak, too. Few
					sailors could imagine the nightmare that existed inside the
					<em>Sea Dog</em>
					. Scoot&#x0027;s pretty face was splashed with engine oil.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="linenum">130</span>
					Over the next five or six minutes, Sully dove repeatedly, using his
					feet as a fulcrum, and using all the strength that he had in his
					arms, legs, and back, in an effort to open the doors. The pressure
					of the water defeated him. Then he thought about trying to pry the
					doors open with the wooden handle of the scrub brush. Too late for
					that, he immediately discovered. It had drifted away, along with
					Scoot&#x0027;s nylon jacket, her canvas boat shoes&#x2014;anything
					that could float.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally he climbed on top of the keel, catching his breath, resting
					a moment, trying desperately to think of a way to enter
					<span class="linenum">140</span>
					the hull. Boats of the Baba class, built for deep-water sailing,
					quite capable of reaching Honolulu and beyond, were almost
					sea-tight unless the sailors made a mistake or unless the sea
					became angry. The side ports were supposed to be dogged securely in
					open ocean. Aside from the cabin doors, there was no entry into
					that cabin without tools. He couldn&#x0027;t very well claw a hole
					through the inch of tough fiberglass.
				</p>
				<p>
					He thought about the hatch on the foredeck, but it could only be
					opened from inside the cabin. Then there was the skylight on the
					top of the seventeen-foot cabin, used for
					<span class="linenum">150</span>
					ventilation as well as a sun source; that butterfly window, hinged
					in the middle, could be opened only from the inside. Even with
					scuba gear, he couldn&#x0027;t open that skylight unless he had
					tools.
				</p>
				<p>He fought back tears of frustration. There was no way to reach
					Scoot. And he knew what would happen down there. The water would
					slowly and inevitably rise until the air pocket was only six
					inches; her head would be trapped between the surface of the water
					and the dirty bilge. The water would torture her, then it would
					drown her. Seawater has no heart,</p>

					no brain. The
					<em>Sea Dog</em>
					would then drop to the ocean floor, thousands of feet down,
					entombing her forever.
				</p>
				<p>Maybe the best hope for poor Scoot was that she was already dead,
					but he had to determine whether she was still alive. He began
					pounding on the hull with the bottom of his fist, waiting for a
					return knock. At the same time, he shouted her name over and over.
					Nothing but silence from inside there. He wished he&#x0027;d hung
					on to the silly scrub brush. The wooden handle would make more
					noise than the flesh of his fist.</p>
				<p>
					Almost half an hour passed, and he finally broke down
					<span class="linenum">170</span>
					and sobbed. His right fist was bloody from the constant pounding.
					Why hadn&#x0027;t
					<em>he</em>
					gone below to make the stupid sandwiches? Scoot would have been at
					the wheel when the wave grasped the
					<em>Sea Dog</em>
					. His young sister, with all her life to live, would be alive now.
				</p>
				<p>
					They&#x0027;d had a good brother-sister relationship. He&#x0027;d
					teased her a lot about being pint-sized and she&#x0027;d teased
					back, holding her nose when he brought one girl or another home for
					display. She&#x0027;d always been spunky. He&#x0027;d taken her
					sailing locally, in the channel, but she&#x0027;d wanted an
					offshore cruise for
					<span class="linenum">180</span>
					her fourteenth birthday. Now she&#x0027;d had one, unfortunately.
				</p>
				<p>Their father had nicknamed her Scoot because, as a baby,
					she&#x0027;d crawled so fast. It was still a fitting name for her
					as a teenager. With a wiry body, she was fast in tennis and
					swimming and already the school&#x0027;s champion in the
					hundred-yard dash.</p>
				<p>
					Eyes closed, teeth clenched, he kept pounding away with the bloody
					fist. Finally he went back into the ocean to try once more to open
					the doors. He sucked air, taking a half-dozen deep breaths, and
					then dove again. Bracing his feet against the
					<span class="linenum">190</span>
					companionway frames, he felt every muscle straining, but the doors
					remained jammed. He was also now aware that if they did open, more
					water would rush in and he might not have time to find Scoot in the
					blackness and pull her out. But he was willing to take the gamble.
				</p>
				<p>Scoot awakened as water seeped into her mouth and nose. For a
					moment she could not understand where she was, how she got there,
					what had happened &#x2026;Vaguely, she remembered the boat slanting
					steeply downward, as if it were suddenly diving, and she remembered
					feeling her body going up.</p>
				<pagenum id="p9" page="normal">9</pagenum>
				<p>
					<span class="linenum">200</span>
					That&#x0027;s all she remembered, and all she knew at the moment
					was that she had a fierce headache and was in chill water in total
					darkness. It took a little longer to realize she was trapped in the
					<em>Sea Dog&#x0027;s</em>
					cabin, by the galley alcove. She began to feel around herself and
					to touch floating things. The air was thick with an oil smell. Then
					she ran her hand over the nearest solid thing&#x2014;a bulkhead.
					<em>That&#x0027;s strange</em>
					, she thought&#x2014;her feet were touching a pot. She lifted her
					right arm and felt above her&#x2014;the galley range. The galley
					range above her?
					<em>The boat was upside down</em>
					. She felt for the companionway steps and found the
					<span class="linenum">210</span>
					entry doors and pushed on them; that was the way she&#x0027;d come
					in. The doors didn&#x0027;t move.
				</p>
				<p>Sully crawled up on the wide hull again, clinging to a faint hope
					that a boat or ship would soon come by; but the sun was already in
					descent, and with night coming on, chances of rescue lessened with
					each long minute. It was maddening to have her a few feet away and
					be helpless to do anything. Meanwhile the hull swayed gently, in
					eerie silence.</p>
				<p>Scoot said tentatively, &#x201C;Sully?&#x201D; Maybe he&#x0027;d
					been drowned. Maybe she was alone and would die here in the foul
					water.</p>
				<p>
					<span class="linenum">220</span>
					She repeated his name, but much more loudly. No answer. She was
					coming out of shock now and fear icier than the water was replacing
					her confusion. To die completely alone? It went that way for a few
					desperate moments, and then she said to herself,
					<em>Scoot, you&#x0027;ve got to get out of here! There has to be
						some way to get out</em>
					&#x2026;
				</p>

				<pagenum id="p10" page="normal">10</pagenum>
				<p>
					Sully clung to the keel with one hand, his body flat against the
					smooth surface of the hull. There was ample room on either side of
					the keel before the dead-rise, the upward slope of the hull. The
					<em>Sea Dog</em>
					had a beam of ten feet. Unless a wind and
					<span class="linenum">230</span>
					waves came up, he was safe enough in his wet perch.
				</p>
				<p>Scoot again wondered if her brother had survived and if he was
					still around the boat or on it. With her right foot she began to
					probe around the space beneath her. The pot had drifted away, but
					her toes felt what seemed to be flatware. That made sense. The
					drawer with the knives and forks and spoons had popped out,
					spilling its contents. She took a deep breath and ducked under to
					pick out a knife. Coming up, she held the knife blade, reaching
					skyward with the handle&#x2026;</p>
				<p>
					Eyes closed, brain mushy, exhausted, Sully heard a faint
					<span class="linenum">240</span>
					tapping and raised up on his elbows to make sure he wasn&#x0027;t
					dreaming. No, there was a tapping from below. He crawled back
					toward what he thought was the source area, the galley area, and
					put an ear to the hull.
					<em>She was tapping!</em>
					He pounded the fiberglass, yelling, &#x201C;Scoot, Scooot,
					Scooot&#x2026;&#x201D;
				</p>
				<p>Scoot heard the pounding and called out, &#x201C;Sully,
					I&#x0027;m here, I&#x0027;m here!&#x201D; Her voice seemed to
					thunder in the air pocket.</p>
				<p>Sully yelled, &#x201C;Can you hear me?&#x201D;</p>
				<p>Scoot could only hear the pounding.</p>
				<p>&#x201C;Help me out of here&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
				<p>
					<span class="linenum">250</span>
					Ear still to the hull, Sully shouted again, &#x201C;Scoot, can you
					hear me?&#x201D; No answer. He pounded again and repeated,
					&#x201C;Scoot, can you hear me?&#x201D; No answer. The hull was too
					thick and the slop of the sea, the moan of the afternoon breeze,
					didn&#x0027;t help.
				</p>
				<p>Though she couldn&#x0027;t hear his voice, the mere fact that he
					was up there told her she&#x0027;d escape. Sully had gotten her out
					of jams before. There was no one on earth that she&#x0027;d rather
					have as a rescue man than her oldest brother. She absolutely knew
					she&#x0027;d survive.</p>
				<p>
					Though it might be fruitless, Sully yelled down to the galley
					<span class="linenum">260</span>
					alcove, &#x201C;Listen to me, Scoot. You&#x0027;ll have to get out
					by yourself. I can&#x0027;t help you. I can&#x0027;t break in.
					Listen to me, I know you&#x0027;re in water, and the best way out
					is through the skylight. You&#x0027;ve got
					<pagenum id="p11" page="normal">11</pagenum>
					to dive down and open it. You&#x0027;re small enough to go through
					it&#x2026;&#x201D; She could go through either section of the
					butterfly window. &#x201C;Tap twice if you heard me!&#x201D;
				</p>
				<p>She did not respond, and he repeated what he&#x0027;d just said,
					word for word.</p>
				<p>No response. No taps from below.</p>
				<p>
					Scoot couldn&#x0027;t understand why he didn&#x0027;t just swim
					down and
					<span class="linenum">270</span>
					open the doors to the cabin, release her. That&#x0027;s all he
					needed to do, and she&#x0027;d be free.

				<p>Sully looked up at the sky. &#x201C;Please, God, help me, help
					us.&#x201D; It was almost unbearable to know she was alive and he
					was unable to do anything for her. Then he made the decision to
					keep repeating: &#x201C;Listen to me, Scoot. You&#x0027;ll have to

					He decided to keep saying it the rest of the day and into
					<span class="linenum">280</span>
					the night or for as long as it took to penetrate the hull with
					words.
					<em>Skylight! Skylight!</em>
					Over and over.
				</p>
				<p>He&#x0027;d heard of mental telepathy but had not thought much
					about it before. Now it was the only way to reach her.</p>
				<p>
					Scoot finally thought that maybe Sully was hurt, maybe helpless up
					on that bottom, so that was why he couldn&#x0027;t open the doors
					and let her out. That had to be the reason&#x2014;Sully
					up&#x2014;there with broken legs.
					<em>So I&#x0027;ll have to get out on my own</em>
					, she thought.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over the last two days, when she wasn&#x0027;t on the wheel she
					<span class="linenum">290</span>
					had been exploring the
					<em>Sea Dog</em>
					, and she thought she knew all the exits. Besides the companionway
					doors, which she knew she couldn&#x0027;t open, there was the hatch
					on the foredeck for access to the sails; then there was the
					skylight, almost
					<pagenum id="p12" page="normal">12</pagenum>
					in the middle of the long cabin. Sully had opened it, she
					remembered, to air out the boat before they sailed. As she clung to
					a light fixture by the alcove, in water up to her shoulders,
					something kept telling her she should first try the butterfly
					windows of the skylight. The unheard message was compelling&#x2014;
					<em>Try the skylight</em>
					.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="linenum">300</span>
					Sully&#x0027;s voice was almost like a recording, a mantra, saying
					the same thing again and again, directed down to the position of
					the galley.
				</p>
				<p>
					Scoot remembered that an emergency flashlight was bracketed on the
					bulkhead above the starboard settee, and she assumed it was
					waterproof. From what Sully had said, Beau Tucker took great care
					in selecting emergency equipment. It might help to actually see the
					dogs on the metal skylight frame. She knew she wouldn&#x0027;t have
					much time to spin them loose. Maybe thirty or forty seconds before
					she&#x0027;d have to surface for breath. Trying
					<span class="linenum">310</span>
					to think of the exact position of the upside-down flashlight, she
					again tapped on the hull to let her brother know she was very much
					alive.
				</p>
				<p>He pounded back.</p>
				<p>Sully looked at his watch. Almost four-thirty. About three hours
					to sundown. Of course, it didn&#x0027;t make much difference to
					Scoot. She was already in dank night. But it might make a
					difference if she got out after nightfall. He didn&#x0027;t know
					what kind of shape she was in. Injured, she might surface and drift
					away.</p>
				<p>
					<span class="linenum">320</span>
					The mantra kept on.
				</p>
				<p>
					Scoot dove twice for the boxy flashlight, found it, and turned it
					on, suddenly splitting the darkness and immediately feeling
					hopeful. But it was odd to see the
					<em>Sea Dog&#x0027;s</em>
					unusual overhead, the open hatchways into the bilge and the debris
					floating on the shining water, all streaked with lubricants; odd to
					see the toilet upside down. She held the light underwater and it
					continued to operate.
				</p>
				<p>
					Every so often, Sully lifted his face to survey the horizon,
					looking for traffic. He knew they were still within sixteen or
					<span class="linenum">330</span>
					seventeen miles of the coast, though the drift was west. There was
					usually small-boat activity within twenty miles of the
					shore&#x2014;fishermen or pleasure boats.
				</p>
				<pagenum id="p13" page="normal">13</pagenum>
				<img id="NIMAS9780544087507-img-083" src="./images/u01/p013_001.jpg"
					alt="" />
				<p>Scoot worked herself forward a few feet, guessing where the
					skylight might be, and then went down to find the butterfly
					windows, the flashlight beam cutting through the murk. It took a
					few seconds to locate them and put a hand on one brass dog. She
					tried to turn it, but it was to tight for her muscles and she rose
					up to breathe again.</p>
				<p>
					Not knowing what was happening below or whether Scoot
					<span class="linenum">340</span>
					was trying to escape, Sully was getting more anxious by the moment.
					He didn&#x0027;t know whether or not the crazy telepathy was
					working. He wished she would tap again to let him know she was
					still alive. It had been more than twenty minutes since
					she&#x0027;d last tapped.
				</p>
				<p>
					Scoot had seen a toolbox under the companionway steps and went back
					to try to find it. She guessed there&#x0027;d be wrenches inside
					it, unless they&#x0027;d spilled out. Using the flashlight again,
					she found the metal box and opened it. Back to the surface to
					breathe again, and then back to the toolbox to extract a wrench.
					<span class="linenum">350</span>
					With each move she was becoming more and more confident.
				</p>
				<p>
					A big sailboat, beating south, came into Sully&#x0027;s view; but
					it was more than two miles away and the occupants&#x2014;unless he
					was very lucky&#x2014;would not be able to spot the
					<em>Sea Dog&#x0027;s</em>
					mound and the man standing on it, waving frantically.
				</p>
				<p>
					Four times Scoot needed to dive, once for each dog; and working
					underwater was at least five times as difficult as trying to turn
					them in usual circumstances. She&#x0027;d aim the light and rest it
					to illuminate the windows. Finally, all the dogs
					<pagenum id="p14" page="normal">14</pagenum>
					were loose and she rose once again. This time, after filling her
					<span class="linenum">360</span>
					lungs to bursting, she went down and pushed on the starboard
					window. It cracked a little, but the outside sea pressure resisted
					and she had to surface again.
				</p>
				<p>Sully sat down, almost giving up hope. How long the air pocket
					would hold up was anybody&#x0027;s guess. The boat had settled at
					least six inches in the last two hours. It might not last into the
					night.</p>
				<p>
					On her sixth dive Scoot found a way to brace her feet against the
					ceiling ribs. She pushed with all her strength, and this time the
					window opened. Almost out of breath, she quickly
					<span class="linenum">370</span>
					pushed her body through and the
					<em>Old Sea Dog</em>
					released her. Treading water beside the hull, she sucked in fresh
					air and finally called out, &#x201C;Sully &#x2026;&#x201D;
				</p>
				<p>He looked her way, saw the grin of triumph on the oil-stained imp
					face, and dived in to help her aboard the derelict.</p>
				<p>Shivering, holding each other for warmth all night, they rode and
					rocked, knowing that the boat was sinking lower each hour.</p>
				<p>
					Just after dawn, the
					<em>Red Rooster</em>
					, a long-range sports fishing boat out of San Diego bound south to
					fish for wahoo
					<span class="linenum">380</span>
					and tuna off the Revilla Gigedo Islands, came within a hundred
					yards of the upside-down sailboat and stopped to pick up its two
					chattering survivors.
				</p>
				<p>
					The
					<em>Red Rooster&#x0027;s</em>
					captain, Mark Stevens, asked, &#x201C;What happened?&#x201D;
				</p>
				<p>&#x201C;Rogue wave,&#x201D; said Sully. That&#x0027;s what he
					planned to say to Beau Tucker as well.</p>
				<p>Stevens winced and nodded that he understood.</p>
				<p>
					The
					<em>Old Sea Dog</em>
					stayed on the surface for a little while longer, having delivered
					her survivors to safety; then her air
					<span class="linenum">390</span>
					pocket breathed its last and she slipped beneath the water, headed
					for the bottom.

				<p>
					The power of a story, such as &#x201C;Rogue Wave,&#x201D; comes
					from its action and events. Most stories follow a series of events,
					also known as the
					<dfn>
						<strong>plot.</strong>
					</dfn>
					A story centers around the
					<dfn>
						<strong>conflict</strong>
					</dfn>
					, the struggle between opposing forces. As the characters struggle
					to resolve a conflict, the plot builds
					<dfn>
						<strong>suspense</strong>
					</dfn>
					, the growing tension and excitement felt by the reader. Most plots
					have five stages:
				</p>
				<list type="pl">
					<li>
						<p>
							&#x2022; The
							<dfn>
								<strong>exposition</strong>
							</dfn>
							introduces the characters and presents the setting and conflict.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							&#x2022; The
							<dfn>
								<strong>rising action</strong>
							</dfn>
							presents complications that intensify.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							&#x2022; The
							<dfn>
								<strong>climax</strong>
							</dfn>
							is the story&#x0027;s moment of greatest interest&#x2014;the
							point where the conflict is resolved.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							&#x2022; In the
							<dfn>
								<strong>falling action</strong>
							</dfn>
							, the story begins to draw to a close.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							&#x2022; The
							<dfn>
								<strong>resolution</strong>
							</dfn>
							reveals the final outcome of the conflict.
						</p>
					</li>
				</list>
				<p>
					Often the plot is influenced by the
					<dfn>
						<strong>setting</strong>
					</dfn>
					, or the time and place of the action. For example, the setting can
					cause plot complications. In &#x201C;Rogue Wave,&#x201D; Sully
					notes that as evening comes, the fading light could hamper his
					rescue efforts. To understand the influence of setting on the plot
					in &#x201C;Rogue Wave,&#x201D; find details that tell where and
					when the events are happening. Use those details to visualize the
					setting and follow the action.

					Authors do not always fully describe every aspect of a story,

					you know.
				</p>
				<p>
					To support your inferences, you may need to
					<strong>cite textual evidence</strong>

					feelings, as shown in the chart. Using a chart like this one can

					<strong>Vocabulary Strategy: Latin Roots</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					A
					<strong>root</strong>
					is a word part that came into English from an older language. Roots
					from the ancient language of Latin appear in many English words.
					Often, by identifying Latin roots, you can figure out the meanings
					of words that seem unfamiliar. For example, the chart shows two
					words from &#x201C;Rogue Wave.&#x201D; Each contains a Latin root
					having to do with the sea.

					<em>Mariners,</em>
					which comes from the Latin root
					<em>mar,</em>
					are sea sailors. The Latin root
					<em>nav</em>
					, from which
					<em>navigation</em>
					comes, appears in words having to do with ships and sailing, such
					as
					<em>navy</em>
					(a fleet of ships) and
					<em>naval</em>
					(having to do with navies). By identifying the roots
					<em>mar</em>
					and
					<em>nav</em>
					, you can make a good guess about the meanings of longer words that
					include them. Relying on a resource such as a print or online
					dictionary also can help you confirm your ideas.
